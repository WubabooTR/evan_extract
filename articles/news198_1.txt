The claim that weed and ginger cures Coronavirus made by the president of the Rastafarian Association Of Ghana has been debunked by independent fact-checkers at Science Feedback (Health Feedback) who found their claim to be false and unsupported by available facts.

There is no evidence supporting the claim that marijuana or ginger has beneficial effects for COVID-19 treatment or cure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that “To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus”.

The U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) has warned that:
 
“The media has reported that some people are seeking “alternative” remedies to prevent infection with COVID-19 or to treat the virus. Some of these purported remedies include herbal therapies and teas. There is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness caused by COVID-19.# In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume.” – the Science Feedback review article read.
