A previous version of this article stated that Joe Exotic had tested positive for Coronavirus. The original information from the prison has since been edited to show that he has only been placed in quarantine as a safety precaution. We apologise for this error.

Joe Maldonado-Passage (aka Joe Exotic) has been placed in quarantine following confirmed cases of coronavirus at his prison.


An earlier report onï¿½Texomashompage.com, stated he had tested positive for COVID-19 and had been transferred to a hospital. However, this is not the case. He has been put in quarantine for his own safety and so that he can properly isolate.

The 57-year-old is currently serving a 22-year sentence for animal abuse as well as attempting to take out a hitman on Carole Baskin.

Joeâ€™s current husband, Dillon Passage, 24, had recently appeared on a radio show to talk about his incarceration and the global pandemic.


Dillon said: â€œSince heï¿½s been moved to this new facility, they are putting him on a COVID-19 isolation because of the previous jail he was at, there were cases.â€

Tiger King is everywhere right now. Youâ€™re either talking about coronavirus, or shouting â€˜Hey there cool cats and kittens!â€™ to your friends over the House Party app.

Although Tiger King puts Joe front and centre, the seven-part series introduced us to the likes of Vegas kingpin Jeff Lowe, eccentric park owner Doc Antle, Jurassic Park-inspired Rick Kirkman, walking Chucky doll James Garretson, and, of course, John Finlay.

The shirt-hating Floridian became famous for his not quite perfect teeth. Heâ€™s now had them sorted, and he looks unrecognisable.

This comes after Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister reopened the case of Caroleâ€™s missing ex-husband, Jack Donald Lewis.

Whatever you think of Netflixâ€™s Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness â€” we assume youâ€™ve binged it all by now â€” thereâ€™s no denying Baskin is one of the seriesâ€™ most divisive characters.

The dramatic climax of Tiger King saw Joe behind bars after being convicted for his part in a murder for hire plot against Carole, however, the road to the final episode was a long one. One of the biggest twists came early on in the series with the revelation Caroleâ€™s first husband vanished under mysterious circumstances. Now, Florida authorities are re-opening the case of Jack Donald Lewis.

Posting on Twitter, Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister shared an appeal and said, â€œSince @NetflixÂ and #Covid19 #Quarantine has made #TigerKing? all the rage, I figured it was a good time to ask for new leads.â€ Chronister also posted a picture of Lewis and reminded everyone he hasnâ€™t been seen since August 18, 1997.

Thereâ€™s no escaping the fact Joe thinks Carole killed her husband and fed him to the tigers â€” an allegation that grows alongside their feud with each other. It also led to the frankly brilliant Tiger King soundbite of, â€œHey Carole, itâ€™s a voice from your pastâ€¦ GET ME THE F**K OUT FROM UNDER THE SEPTIC TANK!â€

The news comes after new claims from author Robert Moore. Moore is something of an expert on all things Baskin and Exotic and spent four years working on a podcast about the whole debacle. Writing on Twitter, Moore claimed he spoke to an ex of Caroleâ€™s and that Baskin once said the ominous line of: â€œDead bodies canï¿½t talkâ€™.â€

Even Gwyneth Paltrow has got in on the action and given her own views on what she thinks happened. One person tweeted, â€œAbsolutely iconic how Carole Baskin did Tiger King thinking sheï¿½d get to expose Joe Exotic and Doc Antle for animal abuse and now all of America is obsessed with Joe and thinks Carole is a murderer. Thatï¿½s showbiz baby.â€ Gwyneth simply wrote back: â€œTHERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION.â€

Iâ€™ll admit, my Tiger King journey was quite the rollercoaster and I went from feeling for Carole to rooting for Joe. While Exotic still languishes behind bars, weâ€™ll have to see if anything comes from the Sheriffâ€™s investigations. The big question is, does Carole know more than sheâ€™s letting on?
