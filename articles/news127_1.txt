A previous version of this article stated that Joe Exotic had tested positive for Coronavirus. The original information from the prison has since been edited to show that he has only been placed in quarantine as a safety precaution. We apologise for this error.

Joe Maldonado-Passage (aka Joe Exotic) has been placed in quarantine following confirmed cases of coronavirus at his prison.

An earlier report on�Texomashompage.com, stated he had tested positive for COVID-19 and had been transferred to a hospital. However, this is not the case. He has been put in quarantine for his own safety and so that he can properly isolate.

The 57-year-old is currently serving a 22-year sentence for animal abuse as well as attempting to take out a hitman on Carole Baskin.

Joe’s current husband, Dillon Passage, 24, had recently appeared on a radio show to talk about his incarceration and the global pandemic.

Dillon said: “Since he�s been moved to this new facility, they are putting him on a COVID-19 isolation because of the previous jail he was at, there were cases.”

Tiger King is everywhere right now. You’re either talking about coronavirus, or shouting ‘Hey there cool cats and kittens!’ to your friends over the House Party app.

Although Tiger King puts Joe front and centre, the seven-part series introduced us to the likes of Vegas kingpin Jeff Lowe, eccentric park owner Doc Antle, Jurassic Park-inspired Rick Kirkman, walking Chucky doll James Garretson, and, of course, John Finlay.

The shirt-hating Floridian became famous for his not quite perfect teeth. He’s now had them sorted, and he looks unrecognisable.

This comes after Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister reopened the case of Carole’s missing ex-husband, Jack Donald Lewis.

Whatever you think of Netflix’s Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness — we assume you’ve binged it all by now — there’s no denying Baskin is one of the series’ most divisive characters.

Among the eccentrics and cult personalities in the stranger-than-fiction world of big cat owners, few stand out more than Joe Exotic, a mulleted, gun-toting polygamist and country western singer who presides over an Oklahoma roadside zoo. Charismatic but misguided, Joe and an unbelievable cast of characters including drug kingpins, conmen, and cult leaders all share a passion for big cats, and the status and attention their dangerous menageries garner. But things take a dark turn when Carole Baskin, an animal activist and owner of a big cat sanctuary, threatens to put them out of business, stoking a rivalry that eventually leads to Joe???s arrest for a murder-for-hire plot, and reveals a twisted tale where the only thing more dangerous than a big cat is its owner. --------- *BACKGRID DOES NOT CLAIM ANY COPYRIGHT OR LICENSE IN THE ATTACHED MATERIAL.

The dramatic climax of Tiger King saw Joe behind bars after being convicted for his part in a murder for hire plot against Carole, however, the road to the final episode was a long one. One of the biggest twists came early on in the series with the revelation Carole’s first husband vanished under mysterious circumstances. Now, Florida authorities are re-opening the case of Jack Donald Lewis.

Posting on Twitter, Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister shared an appeal and said, “Since @Netflix and #Covid19 #Quarantine has made #TigerKing? all the rage, I figured it was a good time to ask for new leads.” Chronister also posted a picture of Lewis and reminded everyone he hasn’t been seen since August 18, 1997.

There’s no escaping the fact Joe thinks Carole killed her husband and fed him to the tigers — an allegation that grows alongside their feud with each other. It also led to the frankly brilliant Tiger King soundbite of, “Hey Carole, it’s a voice from your past… GET ME THE F**K OUT FROM UNDER THE SEPTIC TANK!”

The news comes after new claims from author Robert Moore. Moore is something of an expert on all things Baskin and Exotic and spent four years working on a podcast about the whole debacle. Writing on Twitter, Moore claimed he spoke to an ex of Carole’s and that Baskin once said the ominous line of: “Dead bodies can�t talk’.”

Even Gwyneth Paltrow has got in on the action and given her own views on what she thinks happened. One person tweeted, “Absolutely iconic how Carole Baskin did Tiger King thinking she�d get to expose Joe Exotic and Doc Antle for animal abuse and now all of America is obsessed with Joe and thinks Carole is a murderer. That�s showbiz baby.” Gwyneth simply wrote back: “THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION.”

I’ll admit, my Tiger King journey was quite the rollercoaster and I went from feeling for Carole to rooting for Joe. While Exotic still languishes behind bars, we’ll have to see if anything comes from the Sheriff’s investigations. The big question is, does Carole know more than she’s letting on?
