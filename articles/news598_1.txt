Earlier this week I reported on the cover-up by the Chinese government of outbreak of the Coronavirus.

Now this. Bill Holter of JSMineset is reporting a friend of his states a Chinese friend and resident of Wuhan told him they have 10,000 dead. City falling apart. And while these reports are unconfirmed, we know the most reliable sources are from people on the ground. The least reliable are state or government sources.

The Coronavirus in China is spreading, and largely could have been prevented. A town 7 km from where the virus was discovered in Wuhan had a state run banquet with 100,000 people eating off of the same dishes. This was 2 days after 49 cases were confirmed in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government is trying to save face, and now it is backfiring.
