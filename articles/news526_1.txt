00:54:05

Chad Wolf SO THE DESIGN, THE CONCEPT BEHIND WAIVING THAT SPECIFIC WAIVER WAS TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN --

00:54:37

Jon Tester DOESN'T YOUR PROCUREMENT LAW ELIMINATE ANY BIT BIDDING, ANY PROTEST? HOW DO REHOLD THESE FOLKS ACCOUNT FOOTBALL THEY GET A SWEETHEART DEAL?

00:55:09

Jon Tester YOU HAVE A LIST OF CONTRACTORS THEN?

Chad Wolf THEY HAVE.

00:56:26

Jon Tester HOW MANY HAVE GIVEN YOU PERMISSION TO ACCESS THEIR PROPERTY? FOR A WALL?

00:56:32

00:57:07

Chad Wolf THE ARMY CORPS HAS IN A SMALL HANDFUL OF CASES.

00:57:35

Chad Wolf IT'S A LITTLE LESS. THERE'S AN EXCLUSION ZONE, THERE'S THE PHYSICAL BUILDING OF THE WALL.

00:57:54

Chad Wolf I DON'T KNOW.

00:58:16

Chad Wolf I UNDERSTAND.

00:58:17

Jon Tester THEY'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACTS THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ON THEIR FARM. I'LL YIELD FOR NOW.

01:00:23

James Lankford THAT WILL THAT BE IMPLEMENTED IN THIS FISCAL YEAR?

01:01:57

James Lankford IS IT THE GOAL TO SURGE INTO I.C.E. FACILITIES OR BACK INTO -- [INDISCERNIBLE] --

01:05:43

James Lankford SINCE 1993 THE RFRA HAS NEVER BEEN WAIVED. SO I'D LIKE TO NOT HAVE A FIRST.

01:05:48

Chad Wolf UNDERSTAND.

01:05:50

01:15:50

01:16:57

01:24:30

01:26:05

Chad Wolf AGAIN, WE NEED THE ENTIRE BORDER WALL SYSTEM. SO WE TALK ABOUT THE BORDER WALL SYSTEM --

01:26:10

Jon Tester I GOT IT.

01:26:12

01:29:05

Chad Wolf YES. THEY CONTINUE TO SOW DISCORD WITH OUR ELECTIONS.

01:29:09

Jon Tester WITH THIS BUDGET, DO YOU THINK THIS FULLY -- THIS PROPERLY RESOURCES D.H.S. TO BE ABLE TO ATTACK THIS PROBLEM?

01:29:16

Chad Wolf ABSOLUTELY.

01:29:17

Jon Tester YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF MAKING SURE THE STATES ARE ONBOARD, SO THEY KNOW YOU'RE THERE TO GIVE THEM A BACK STOP?

01:30:36

Jon Tester WHO DID IT?

01:30:37

Chad Wolf I BELIEVE IT WAS -- A NUMBER OF FOLKS TO INCLUDE SECRET SERVICE, BUT ALSO OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT.

01:30:47

Jon Tester WAS IT AN INDEPENDENT GROUP WHO HAD NO DOG IN THE FIGHT?

01:30:50

Chad Wolf NO, I BELIEVE THERE WERE FOLKS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHO NEED TO BE INVOLVED.

01:31:28

Chad Wolf THANK YOU.

01:31:29

Jon Tester GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

01:31:30
