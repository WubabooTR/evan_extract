Some £87,135 ($108,000) has been raised as a “starting point to support the immediate family” of a Ghanaian pregnant nurse who died of coronavirus in the UK.

Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, popularly known as MaryMo, passed on a week later after she was admitted to hospital on 7 April for Covid-19.

A hospital trust spokeswoman said the nurse’s “child was doing very well”.

The Gofundme fundraisers, Rhoda Asiedu, Gloria Gyan and Wendy Addai, say “it is humane” for Mary’s family to be taken care of in “this heavy and trying time”.

The fundraiser has overdone its target of £2,000 and had raised £87,135 as of 0900GMT April 16, 2020.

A former colleague at work said Mary devoted her life to the NHS as a nurse.

Renai Mcinerney wrote: “Sister Mary was my colleague, I worked alongside her for a few years.

“She deserves her family to be looked after, after she devoted her life to the NHS as a nurse.

“It’s time to look out/after our own and return the selflessness persona Mary carried and give something so small, but so big to her family in this time of need. RIP sister Mary!”

Mary, 28, was survived by a husband and “little Mary”, who was delivered through a C-section.
