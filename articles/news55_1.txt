WASHINGTON, DC – The Pentagon has issued an indefinite hold order to all military air wings and airlines to immediately stop spraying chemtrails until it can be determined how the Covid-19 virus found its way into the chemtrail fluid supply.

According to an unofficial Pentagon source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, “The entire chemtrail program is on hold until we can figure out who coughed onto a batch of chemicals being manufactured at one of our supplier’s factories.”

News of this apparent confirmation that chemtrails are real spread online like a virus. FOX News reported that President Trump is considering using the spraying capabilities of the chemtrail program to immunize the entire country from Covid-19 when the vaccine is ready.
