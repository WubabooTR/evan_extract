girl complains of a stinging on her arm, doctors find out whats going on A 12 year old girl named kylee has been experiencing issues lately. We call this disease "The Merlin" or "The Merlin Disease" aka "Merlinlissal". A girl complains of stinging on her arm, so her 47 year old mother decides to take her to a doctor. This disease is insanely rare, about a 0.02 chance of happening to anybody. This is when your body experiences "Heat trances" known to be "hot blood" throughout your body. This can occur if you take hot showers, eat hot things, or even touch hot things. Your body could become allergic. When the Merlinlissal happens, You feel a serious heat pain in a part of your body. This Could be called linilal anihile disorder, where your body experiences heat shots. This heat shot can range up to 3000 degrees if it wanted to. Every heat shot you experience gets worse. This can make you feel thanataphobia, or even arachnaphobia. It can make you fall asleep a lot more, slow down your brain, and make you feel very hasted and tired. This heat shot will get worse every time, and is also unexpected. There isn't much ways to treat this, some people say you can try to put an ice pack over the disease, but it won't work. Kylee was experiencing 5x the pain that day which just turned into a worse phenomenon. We hate to say this, but there may be no cure for linlal anihile disorder. (The Merlinlissal disease). Another suggestion Doctor Skirt had for this issue was trying to get a hyperborean shot that will tease the heat shots and cool them down a bit.
