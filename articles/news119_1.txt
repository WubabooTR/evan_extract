Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI), the living embodiment of clueless privilege, said he hopes some sectors of the economy reopen so the U.S. economy doesn't suffer long term. In explaining his reasoning, Johnson said, "death is an unavoidable part of life."

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin in a USA Today op-ed article published Sunday called for reopening parts of the American economy to avoid throwing it into a recession or depression, saying that "death is an unavoidable part of life."

Though Johnson didn't advocate fully starting up the economy, he said the crisis should be put into perspective.

"What more people are saying is that as we learn more about COVID-19, we should evaluate the total societal cost of this awful disease and try to put things into perspective," Johnson said.
