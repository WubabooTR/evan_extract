BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) -- Buffalo police body-camera footage of a raid in January shows a chaotic scene at a duplex on Oakdale Place, where officers said they were there to provide security for armed bounty hunters searching for a fugitive.

The raid, which started on Jan. 10 and continued through the next morning, is the subject of a federal civil rights lawsuit against the City of Buffalo, a Pennsylvania bail company, two unknown bounty hunters and unnamed city officers.
