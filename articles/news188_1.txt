Earlier today it was rumoured that Queen Elizabeth II had tested positive for the novel coronavirus while many UK media outlets have kept silent.

In a new press release, the Buckingham Palace has confirmed that the Queen of the United Kingdom has indeed tested positive.

The 93-year-old could have come into contact with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who tested positive yesterday.

The Royal Palace said in the statement:

“HMQ has also tested positive and is currently self-isolating at Windsor Castle. The Queen came into contact with the PM on the 11th March and is following all the appropriate advice with regards to her welfare”.

“We will be sharing constant updates of the Queen’s welfare with the public in good fate. That will be all for now.”

Some few days ago, the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles tested positive to the deadly Covid-19 after showing mild symptoms and in self-isolation in Scotland.
