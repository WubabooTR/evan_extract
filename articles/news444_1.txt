The manâ€™s cause of death has not yet been determined, but plenty of people suspect that he may have died of the coronavirus.



The incident occurred in Flushing Queens, an area of the city filled with Chinese immigrants.According to reports, a man was walking down the street, when he was suddenly overcome with a bought of coughing. He collapsed onto the floor, and after a few seconds, he stopped moving.

As the video shows, officers quickly arrived on the scene, but seemed unwilling to physically assist the man, perhaps out of fear.
